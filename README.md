🦸 Build reliable and simple to customise AI Agent workflows using any Agent - batteries included.

## Why

The developer experience for orchestrating multi-agents for reliable and repeatable workflows in production is still lacking.

Currently, a developer has to work close to the metal. They have to source and glue various libraries and tools for every project they create. Then revert into DevOPS mode to factor in cost monitoring, setting up any required prompt/model fine-tuning pipelines and finally deployment.

Also, adding reliability checks requires custom code that varies depending on the frameworks used. Agent reuse is another hurdle, especially sourcing and vetting agents to ensure they work as advertised.

Orra is here to take you to the next level.
