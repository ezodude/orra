## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### What is orra?

Orra is infrastructure for resilient AI agent workflows. It provides a plan engine that coordinates tasks across agents, tools, and your existing stack, with durable execution, state persistence, failure recovery, and audit logging — all designed to work with any language, agent framework, or deployment platform.

### How is orra different from agent frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI?

Agent frameworks focus on building individual agents (tool calling, memory, reasoning loops). Orra focuses on **orchestrating multiple agents in production** — handling failure recovery, state persistence, execution plan validation, and workflow coordination. You can use orra alongside any agent framework.

### How is orra different from MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) handles **connecting** LLMs to external tools and data sources. Orra handles **coordinating complex workflows** — planning, execution, failure recovery, and state management. They complement each other: use MCP to expose tool capabilities, then use orra to orchestrate those tools in production workflows.

### What languages and frameworks does orra support?

Orra is language and framework agnostic. It works with any language and any agent framework through its HTTP API. Current examples include JavaScript/TypeScript and Python (with CrewAI integration). Additional SDKs for Ruby, .NET, and Go are coming soon.

### Can I run orra locally?

Yes. Orra's Plan Engine runs as a Docker container. You can start it locally with Docker Compose for development, or deploy it on-premises using Kubernetes or any container orchestration platform.

### What LLM models does orra support?

Orra requires two types of models:
- **Reasoning models**: For task planning (e.g., DeepSeek R1, QwQ-32b, or any OpenAI-compatible model)
- **Embedding models**: For execution plan caching (e.g., Jina embeddings v2 small)

Any model serving solution that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API works — vLLM, LMStudio, Ollama, Replicate, etc. Self-hosted models are fully supported.

### How does orra handle failures?

Orra provides multiple failure recovery mechanisms:
- **Durable execution**: State is persisted to BadgerDB, so workflows survive crashes and restarts
- **Revert state**: Automatically roll back to previous states when failures occur
- **Pre-validated execution plans**: Plans are validated before execution to catch issues early
- **Automatic health monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of agent and tool health
- **Escalation**: Failed tasks can be escalated to fallback agents or human operators

### How do I deploy orra in production?

Options include:
- **Local development**: Single Docker instance via Docker Compose
- **On-premises**: Deploy on your own infrastructure with Kubernetes or preferred orchestration
- **Managed cloud**: Run on container services like DigitalOcean App Platform
- Book office hours with the orra team for production deployment guidance

### How does the plan engine work?

1. **Planning**: The planning agent analyzes your workflow goals and discovers available agents/tools
2. **Validation**: Execution plans are pre-validated before running
3. **Execution**: Tasks are coordinated across agents, tools, and services
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time status tracking and audit logs provide full visibility
5. **Recovery**: Automatic failure detection and state rollback keep workflows moving

### Is there a cloud version?

Orra is primarily designed for self-hosting and on-premises deployment. Check the orra website and docs for cloud hosting options.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - For running the Plan Engine
- Set up Reasoning and Embedding Models to power task planning and execution plan caching/validation

#### Setup Models for Plan Engine

Select from a variety of supported models:

**Reasoning Models**:
- OpenAI's `o1-mini` or `o3-mini` on cloud
- `deepseek-r1` or `qwq-32b` on cloud or self-hosted (on-premises or locally)

**Embedding Models**:
- OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` on cloud
- `jina-embeddings-v2-small-en` on cloud or self-hosted (on-premises or locally)

> **Note**: The Plan Engine requires all model endpoints to be **OpenAI API-compatible**. Most model serving solutions (like vLLM, LMStudio, Ollama, etc.) can be configured to expose this compatible API format.

**Quick Cloud Setup Example**:

Update the .env based on the [_env](planengine/_env) file with one of these:

```shell
# OpenAI Reasoning
LLM_MODEL=o1-mini
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1

# OpenAI Embeddings
EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY=your_api_key
EMBEDDINGS_API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

**Self-hosted/On-premises Example**:

Update the .env based on the [_env](planengine/_env) file with one of these:

```shell
# Self-hosted QwQ model
LLM_MODEL=qwq-32b-q8
LLM_API_KEY=your_internal_key  # Optional depending on your setup
LLM_API_BASE_URL=http://your-internal-server:8000/v1

# Self-hosted Jina embeddings
EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=jina-embeddings-v2-small-en
EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY=your_internal_key  # Optional depending on your setup
EMBEDDINGS_API_BASE_URL=http://your-internal-server:8001/v1
```

## How The Plan Engine Works

The Plan Engine powers your multi-agent applications through intelligent planning and reliable execution:

### Progressive Planning Levels

#### 1. Base Planning

Your agents stay clean and simple (wrapped in the orra SDK):

**Python**
```python
from orra import OrraAgent, Task
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ResearchInput(BaseModel):
    topic: str
    depth: str

class ResearchOutput(BaseModel):
    summary: str

agent = OrraAgent(
    name="research-agent",
    description="Researches topics using web search and knowledge base",
    url="https://api.orra.dev",
    api_key="sk-orra-..."
)

@agent.handler()
async def research(task: Task[ResearchInput]) -> ResearchOutput:
    results = await run_research(task.input.topic, task.input.depth)
    return ResearchOutput(summary=results.summary)
```

**JavaScript**
```javascript
import { initAgent } from '@orra.dev/sdk';

const agent = initAgent({
  name: 'research-agent',
  orraUrl: process.env.ORRA_URL,  
  orraKey: process.env.ORRA_API_KEY
});

await agent.register({
  description: 'Researches topics using web search and knowledge base',
  schema: {
    input: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        topic: { type: 'string' },
        depth: { type: 'string' }
      }
    },
    output: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        summary: { type: 'string' }
      }
    }
  }
});

agent.start(async (task) => {
  const results = await runResearch(task.input.topic, task.input.depth);
  return { summary: results.summary };
});
```

Features:
* AI analyzes intent and creates execution plans that target your components
* Automatic service discovery and coordination
* Parallel execution where possible

#### 2. Production Planning with Domain Grounding

```yaml
# Define domain constraints
name: research-workflow
domain: content-generation
use-cases:
  - action: "Research topic {topic}"
    capabilities: 
      - "Web search access"
      - "Knowledge synthesis"
constraints:
  - "Verify sources before synthesis"
  - "Maximum research time: 10 minutes"
```

Features:
* Full semantic validation of execution plans
* Capability matching and verification
* Safety constraints enforcement
* State transition validation

#### 3. Reliable Execution

```bash
# Execute an action with the Plan Engine
orra verify run "Research and summarize AI trends" \
  --data topic:"AI in 2024" \
  --data depth:"comprehensive"
```

The Plan Engine ensures:
* Automatic service health monitoring
* Stateful execution tracking
* Built-in retries and recovery
* Real-time status updates
* Webhook events for result delivery and monitoring

### Real-World Examples

**Use MCP when:**
- Adding web search to your Claude chatbot
- Connecting an LLM to your company's database
- Building a research assistant that needs multiple data sources

**Use Orra when:**
- Orchestrating fraud detection agent pipelines without writing custom abort/retry logic or state management
- Building incident response agent workflows without implementing failure recovery or escalation infrastructure
- Creating e-commerce agent workflows without building compensation logic or transaction coordination

### Can They Work Together?

Yes! MCP handles the "how do I connect to systems" while orra handles the "how do I coordinate complex workflows." You might use MCP to expose individual agent capabilities, then use Orra to orchestrate those agents in production workflows.

## Self Hosting & On-premises Deployment

### Running Plan Engine

The orra Plan Engine is packaged with a [Dockerfile](planengine/Dockerfile) for easy deployment:

- **Local Development**: [Run it as a single instance](#installation) using Docker or Docker Compose
- **On-premises Deployment**: Deploy in your own infrastructure with your preferred orchestration system
- **Cloud Service**: Run on managed container services like [Digital Ocean's App Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/deploy-from-monorepo/) or any Kubernetes environment

### Using Self-hosted Models (Remote or On-premises)

The Plan Engine fully supports self-hosted open-source models:

- **Reasoning**: Deploy `deepseek-r1` or `qwq-32b` using your preferred model serving solution including on-premises 
- **Embeddings**: Self-host `jina-embeddings-v2-small-en` for complete control

> **Important**: Your model serving solution must expose an **OpenAI-compatible API**. Solutions like vLLM, LMStudio, Ollama with OpenAI compatibility mode, or Replicate all work great.

→ [Complete Model Configuration Guide](docs/model-configuration.md)

### Data Storage

The Plan Engine uses [BadgerDB](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/badger) embedded database to persist all state - operational information is queryable using the [orra CLI](docs/cli.md).
